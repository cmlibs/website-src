CMLibs.org website source
=========================

This repository contains the source files for the cmlibs.org website.
The website is built using GitHub actions and published at staging.cmlibs.org for the staging branch, and cmlibs.org for the production branch.
The website gets built and deployed when pull requests are merged in.
New changes should come from a pull request to the staging branch.
Deployment to production should only be made through pull requests from staging, hot fixes would be the main reason this sometimes doesn't happen.
